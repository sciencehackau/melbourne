<h4 dir="ltr">I will keep it G-rated and be mindful of language</h4>
<p dir="ltr">I will not swear or make sexist, racist, or other exclusionary jokes, which may be offensive to those around me. I will behave in a way (only submit competition material) that is suitable for anyone to view, including young children.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">I will respect the venue and equipment</h4>
<p dir="ltr">I will keep the venue clean and tidy and use the rubbish and recycling bins as appropriate. I will let the organisers know if there are any issues.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">I shall follow the competition rules</h4>
<p dir="ltr">I will only use authorised materials that I have the right to use and release and will not submit any projects which are potentially libelous, false, defamatory or overtly political or contains material which is potentially confidential, commercially sensitive, or which would cause personal distress or loss.

<p dir="ltr">I will remember that we are all here to create, not party. If I am under 18, I will ensure my guardian is with me whenever I am at the venue, and if I am the guardian of a participant under 18 I will ensure I keep an eye on them. If I am feeling uncomfortable, am being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns; I will immediately contact a <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a> organiser.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">And remember that the <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a> crew are in charge and have put a lot of effort into organising a great event</h4>
<p dir="ltr">I will not do anything to ruin it or engage in any behavior that violates this code of conduct. I understand that the <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a> organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings or expulsion from the <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a> event.
