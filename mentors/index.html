<h2 id="csiro" valign="center"><a href="http://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a></h2>

<p>At the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), we shape the future. We do this by using science to solve real issues. Our research makes a difference to people, industry and the planet. We ask, we seek, we solve.</p>

<p>Since we started as the CSIR in 1926, we’ve advanced Australia with a range of inventions and innovations that have had significant positive impact on the lives of people around the world. </p>

<p>We're an Australian Government corporate entity, operating under the Science and Industry Research Act 1949, under the Department of Industry and Science.</p>

<h2 id="geoscience-australia"><a href="http://www.ga.gov.au">Geoscience Australia</a></h2>

<p>We apply geoscience to Australia's most important challenges by providing geoscience information, services and capability to the Australian Government, industry and stakeholders. We deliver a range of products that address important and significant national issues, and contributes information to decisions on economic, social and environmental management of the nation's resources.</p>

<p>As the national geoscientific agency, Geoscience Australia provides stewardship of a vast range of data that supports decision making in the management of Australia's precious water resources, hazard modeling for safer communities; and exploration for mineral and petroleum resources.</p>

<p>We're an Australian Government listed entity within the Industry and Science portfolio.</p>

        I’m the CSIRO Science Leader for Earth Science Informatics. I'm
        interested in data driven science, including simulation, remotely
        operated instruments, and high performance and cloud computing. I also
        work with organizations like <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/">ANDS</a>
        on long-term preservation of research data, and I can help you find
        some of the more interesting datasets in the Research Data Australia
        and CSIRO data archives. I'm on twitter <a
        href="http://twitter.com/snet_jklump">@snet_jklump</a>, or send me an
        email: <a href="mailto:jens.klump@csiro.au">jens.klump@csiro.au</a>.
