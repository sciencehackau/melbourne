<p>Are you a competitor in Melbourne Science Hackfest? We'll have data mentors
from CSIRO, TERN, ALA and AURIN available for the duration of the weekend to
answer your questions, help you with project ideas and with finding any extra
data you might need. </p>

        <em>Jens Klump</em><br>
I'm the CSIRO Science Leader for Earth Science Informatics. I'm
        interested in data driven science, including simulation, remotely
        operated instruments, and high performance and cloud computing. I also
        work with organizations like <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/">ANDS</a> on long-term preservation of research data, and I can help you find
        some of the more interesting datasets in the Research Data Australia
        and CSIRO data archives. I'm on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/snet_jklump">@snet_jklump</a>, or send me an
      email: <a href="mailto:jens.klump@csiro.au">jens.klump@csiro.au</a>. </td>

        <em>Jess Robertson</em><br>
      I’m a geologist/physicist/data scientist at the CSIRO. I work on a range of science projects across the organisation, generally using geoscience and geospatial data with machine learning and data analysis to improve exploration and production strategies for the minerals and mets sector. As well as science-y things, you can ask me about webservices, maps and geospatial data. Python is my poison of choice. Ping me on twitter <a

        <em>Peter Isaac</em><br>
Peter originally trained as a meteorologist with the New Zealand Meteorological Service in the early '80s but was never able to get the forecast right, so moved into air quality research before going sideways into the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research when New Zealand science was restructured in the early '90s.  In the throes of a mid-life crisis in 1994, he began a PhD at Flinders University, did a post-doc at Monash University in 2007 and then fell out of academia.  He now works as the Data Manager for OzFlux, the TERN facility that operates a network of sites around Australia measuring the exchange of water and carbon between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. <br>
Peter started massaging data with FORTRAN 77 programs written using the TECO editor (look it up!), used QuickBASIC to write data acquisition programs and then fell in love with IDL.  That affair ended badly when Kodak took over IDL but after a short period of heartbreak he discovered Python and has happily known requited love ever since. </td>

        <em>Peter Löwe</em><br>
Peter is a physical Geographer. He learned the ropes of GIS at UT Austin in 1994 and ventured into FOSS GIS during his PhD study (Radar meteorology/Soil Erosion in South Africa, which relied heavily on GRASS GIS and for which he received several awards. Following his PhD he founded GEOMANCERS.net (now: GISIX.com), producing GISIX, the first portable FOSSGIS workbench based on a live-Linux CD/DVD. He also worked as a Ranger in the UNESCO Geopark Bergstrasse-Odenwald (south of Frankfurt a.M., Germany), developing prototype WebGIS-solutions and Globe-Browser interfaces for the trail network. He actively advocates FOSSGIS in Science in the Earth and Space Informatics (ESSI) chapters of both the European Geoscience Union (EGU) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and has been organizing OSGeo Townhall events at the annual EGU General Assembly since 2014. Since 2015 he is a member of the OSGeo Open Geoscience Committee. <br>
For the development of early warning systems, triggered by the Sumatra Tsunami of 2004, he joined the National German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in Potsdam in 2006. After a two-year excursion into the remote sensing satellite industry (Rapideye AG) he returned to GFZ for work at the Centre for Geoinformation Technology in 2011. His work focused on project management, large scale computing on the GFZ High Performance Cluster and data visualisation, including3D Printing. In 2013 Peter joined the German National Library for Science and Technology (TIB Hannover) as head of the library’s development department), while continuing to support FOSS GIS for High Performance Computing / Big Data. </td>
