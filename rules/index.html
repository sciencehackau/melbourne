<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.the-hackfest.com/events/melbourne-science-hackfest/">The Hackfest</a> &nbsp;is the Official Melbourne Science HackFest competition submission site and allows you to submit all components required for your team&rsquo;s Melbourne Science HackFest entry. &nbsp;&nbsp;Note: submission elements and times are system controlled so no extensions are available! Teams are required to submit the following as part of their competition entry on The Hackfest :</p>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Register all Team members</strong> in <a href="http://www.the-hackfest.com/events/melbourne-science-hackfest/">the Hackfest</a> and select &ldquo;Melbourne Science Hackfest&rdquo; to enter the challenge. (If your team win we can only recognise registered team members).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Taking part in hackfest:</strong> Any participant can enter the challenge by registering at the competition official website which is hosted at <a href="http://www.the-hackfest.com/events/melbourne-science-hackfest/">the Hackfest</a>. Participant can create a project in <a href="http://www.the-hackfest.com/events/melbourne-science-hackfest/">the Hackfest</a> by providing &nbsp;details about your project, what data sets will be used, link to source code and any information. &nbsp;The project page must include your Project Description Data Story. &nbsp;This is a short description that describes how data has been reused and what your project is about. Participants need to use at least one significant dataset from the data providers listed in the website <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/</a>. Submit an image that best captures your concept e.g a logo or Image. If you win an award this is what we will use to describe your project. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr"><strong>Outcomes from the project itself</strong> (any code, graphics, mashups, applications, website URLs, photos of each &nbsp;stage to create your artistic representation etc) which must all be made available under an open source/content licence to be eligible for prizes. If judges are able to see and play with it that is useful, but this is a minor component of the judging. Teams can put the code/source on GitHub, Sourceforge or an equivalent repository system and must make the URL available on their project page for verification. For artistic works you may need to create a photo library or share a link to a Google Doc that contains evidence of the stages of your project. All the links should be provided in &nbsp;<a href="http://www.the-hackfest.com/events/melbourne-science-hackfest/">the Hackfest</a> project page.

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-f5c35684-0c01-d49d-2993-bb3c6ed8af6d">Data</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">You will find the list of Official data available for the <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a> competition at<a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/</a>. You must use at least one Official data set as a significant component of your project to be eligible for prizes. Check the eligibility requirements of the <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a> Prizes to see if you need to use a specific data set or data from a specific Data Publisher or Data Portal for the prize category you want to enter. To maximize your chances to win we recommend you mash-up more than one official data source.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some data sets listed on data portals may have additional resources available with further information on how to use the data or other supporting material. You are encouraged to download and use these resources. If you have questions about a data set let a crew member know and we will try to find a data mentor for you or post the question on the Hackfest forum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Competition goals require that entries must use at least one of the data sets provided for this contest, but you are free to use data from the official <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a> list or other data sets as long as their licensing terms permit usage for this purpose. You may also use any publicly accessible web services as long as it does not incur a financial cost to use (private and subscription APIs are prohibited due to licensing issues and barrier to entry).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-f5c35684-0c01-d49d-2993-bb3c6ed8af6d">Eligibility</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">To be eligible for prizes, individual entrants must be either an Australian citizen or a current Australian resident (this includes temporary student residents). &nbsp;For team entrants, at least one member of the team must be an Australian citizen or a current Australian resident (this includes temporary student residents). It&rsquo;s only fair – it is an Australian <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a> competition after all. At least one team member must be over 18 (Or a guardian must be registered as the Representative to facilitate prizes). Since this is a physical hackathon, all the participants must present at the venue all the time and any virtual participants are not allowed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Judges expect entries to be primarily developed throughout the weekend of <a href="http://sciencehackau.github.io/melbourne/">Melbourne Science Hackfest</a>. If submissions are shown to have been worked on before the weekend, the submission will be ineligible for prizes. This does not include reuse or extension of existing software, libraries or data sets. Entrants may be members of multiple teams but each team must be registered separately and each team has one entry. There is no maximum team size.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No judges will be eligible to compete for prizes, and individuals from organisations or companies are also not eligible for prizes sponsored by their organisation. Mentors/speakers are eligible to compete for prizes, but judges reserve the right to disqualify a mentor/speaker if they perceive unfairness.</p>
